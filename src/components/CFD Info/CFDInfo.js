          A CFD or Contract For Difference is an agreement between two parties to the trade (Buyer
          and Seller) to exchange the difference in value between the opening and closing price for
          a particular asset. Trade opening price would be the price in effect at the moment the
          agreement is made at while the closing price would be the price at which the agreement is
          executed. Essentially trading CFDs boils down to a contract between yourself as a Client
          and the market. You open a trade by purchasing a contract for a particular asset and close
          the trade by selling the contract back to the market, hopefully making a profit in the
          process. CFDs don’t necessarily have to be on the Buy side. As with all trades, you can
          open a CFD trade on the sell side. The principle remains the same. Buying the contract
          back from the market to close the trade would hopefully result in profit.

          CFD contract sizes are fixed. CFDs on shares, for example, are made on the value of 100
          shares of the company in question. For example, a contract for Google shares (GOOGL) would
          be for the value of 100 shares in the search engine giant. At today’s price of USD 853.69,
          that would make a full contract worth $85,369.

          As with forex trading, CFDs are leveraged products. Trading with a 1:30 broker would
          effectively allow you to control $30 worth of trades for every $1 deposited in your
          account. At this leverage, you would need $2,845.56 in your account to trade a full
          contract of Google shares. Sticking with the Google example, if you believe the share
          price will increase, you will Buy a contact which would then be Sold back at the higher
          price. This is where the "for difference" comes it. There is no physical delivery of
          Google shares involved. The contract is purely for the difference between the opening and
          closing prices. Buy a contract for Google at USD 853.69. Let's assume the share price
          rises to USD 875.69. Closing the trade makes a profit of $22 per share (875.69-853.69) for
          a total on the contract of $2,200 (22 x 100). Conversely, if we think Google shares will
          fall in value, we would sell a contract at the USD 853.69 level.
