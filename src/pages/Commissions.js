                <h2>What is Swap</h2>
                <p>
                  A forex swap rate is defined as an overnight or rollover interest rate (positive
                  or negative) for holding positions overnight in foreign exchange or CFDs trading.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A swap charge is determined based on the interest rates of the countries involved
                  in each currency pair and whether the position is short or long. Each currency
                  pair has its own swap rate and is measured in points. The particular size of swap
                  charged or paid depends on the size of your position. Swap rates are subject to
                  change based on interest rate policies of central banks and the liquidity on the
                  inter-bank lending markets.
                </p>

                  Swaps (rollovers) take place for all positions opened before 00:00 MT4 server time
                  that are still open after 00:00.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When your rollover an open position from Wednesday to Thursday, the settlement
                  date is Monday, (Forex settlement of T+2); therefore, the rollover charge on a
                  Wednesday evening will be three times the value indicated above. This is called
                  Triple Swap Wednesday.
